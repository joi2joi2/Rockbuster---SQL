# Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. 

I was asked to help launch the new online video service by loading all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions other departments may have.
